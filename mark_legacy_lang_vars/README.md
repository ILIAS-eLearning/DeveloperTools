the "lang_deprecated_leg.csv" file.

This script needs two arguments:

- Ilias language file full path

- Full path of the file which contains all the deprecated values.

    python mark_deprecated_lang_vars.py /Users/Sites/ilias/lang/ilias.en.lang /Users/Doe/Desktop/lang_deprecated_leg.csv




## 2-. PARSE ENGLISH VERSION AND UPDATE ALL THE OTHER LANGUAGE FILES
file -> mark_deprecated_vars_in_other_languages.py

Before executing the script, is highly recommended to duplicate the language files that is wanted to modify.

This script parses ilias_en.lang and for each entry that contains "###deprecated" at the end,
a corresponding comment must be added in all the rest language files.

For each line which contain language string:

If the line does not contain a "###deprecated" comment, but the entry appears in the english file as deprecated, the comment ###deprecated is added at the end of the line.
All other comments existing like "###07 02 2017 new variable" are removed

If the line does contain a "###deprecated" comment, but does not appear in english version, it is removed.

Example:

    python mark_deprecated_vars_in_other_languages.py /Users/Doe/Sites/ilias5_2/ILIAS/lang/ilias_en.lang
